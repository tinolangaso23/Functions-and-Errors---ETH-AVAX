Understanding require(), assert(), and revert()

Overview
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. These statements are essential for enforcing preconditions, validating internal state, and handling exceptional cases in smart contract development.

Requirements
To interact with the smart contract, you'll need:

A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
An Ethereum wallet or client (e.g., MetaMask) to deploy and interact with the contract on a testnet or mainnet

1. require()
The require() function is used to enforce conditions that must be met for a function to execute successfully.
It acts as a guard, validating inputs and preventing invalid state changes.
If the condition specified in require() evaluates to false, the transaction is reverted, and any gas consumed up to that point is refunded.
Example: Ensuring that a user’s balance is sufficient before allowing a withdrawal.

2. assert()
The assert() function checks for conditions that should never be false.
It is primarily used to validate invariants, such as checking the balance of an account after an operation.
If the condition in assert() evaluates to false, it indicates an internal error or a bug in the code, and the contract execution is reverted.
Unlike require(), assert() does not refund any gas; it consumes all remaining gas.
Example: Verifying that an account balance remains consistent after a transfer.

3. revert()
The revert() function triggers exceptions and can have an associated error message.
It is useful for handling exceptional cases and aborting transactions when specific conditions aren’t met.
Similar to require(), it refunds any remaining gas.
Example: Customizing error messages for specific failure scenarios.
